## Abstract
This project presents a machine learning-based approach for detecting spam emails. Utilizing natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms, our system classifies emails as either spam or legitimate. Our results demonstrate high accuracy and efficiency in detecting spam emails, making this system a valuable tool for improving email security and reducing the risk of phishing attacks and malware infections.
